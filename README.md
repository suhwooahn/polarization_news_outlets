# Ideological Polarization and Modernization of News Outlets

This project examines ideological polarization and modernization of news outlets in South Korea.

Using Korea as a test case, we investigate how individual news outlets positioned themselves between 2001 and 2018. We collected 598,998 news articles from 32 news outlets published between 2001 and 2018. When facing 'hypercompetition,' one countering strategy has been ideological marketing. Applying supervised machine learning techniques, we track the ideological leanings of individual news outlets. Our results show that latecomer news outlets often employ the strategy of polarization in order to create a niche market. In contrast, faced with the influx of ideologically extreme new competitors, established news outlets often reposition themselves by moderating their partisan tone. We collected and used the dataset for the first time.
